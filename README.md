Place for links to useful documentation and information. 
If possible and the source itself is not too large, save also the docs themselves because weblocations may change or become outdated.

## 64 bit assembly programming docs
Google search on 'amd64 assembly reference' gives a bunch of links to useful reference and starting material.
On Linux Questions http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/a-good-amd64-assembly-tutorial-941399/ user johnsfine gives some good looking tips and advice 
`26568 covers SSE2, which is a nice next step after the basics.
For more advanced 64 bit programming you should also find 24593. 
To find any of these (they move around) I do a google search for AMD and the document number.`

## Garbage Collection
There is already a branch in the original project that contains a start with the Simple GC

    https://github.com/red/red/tree/simple-gc

Search Google again (or maybe use duckduckgo.com if you prefer that) "simple garbage collector" and this results in a number of nice links

## Other topics
In time or add them here yourself. Think about View on FreeBSD, Haiku or the GTK3 branch. Adding date to now. Almost anything goes.
